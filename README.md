<p align="center">Convert your currency to any foreign currency and view the conversion rate.</p>

## The Problem

- I'm not able to find any good currency converter online
- I need a project to waste my free time
- Currency converter is kinda cool and useful
- I want to keep track on how sucks the currency of my country can go

## The Solution

I made a currency converter. But it's not just a currency converter. You can view a whole list of convertion rate of any currency to currency of all other countries. Not only that, you can also see that chart of conversion rates of some countries over the years.
